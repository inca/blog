Is this something stupid to say? Or does that make some sense? ðŸ¤”

Disclaimer: I'm not a mathematician. Not even close. Not even _almost_ mathematician.

I've once used this "almost infinitely" phrase somewhere (in some random non-scientific context), but somehow it immediately felt awkward. Like the time you use a phrase and not sure if it means what you intended to say.

A quick googling to satisfy my [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) has revealed that I'm not [the][l1] [only][l2] [one][l3] [who][l4] [is][l4] curious on the subject.

## What is "infinity"?

To avoid reciting the entire internet, here are few relevant facts about %%\infty%%.

{.sidenote}
For the sake of sanity we only focus on a "really really big" infinity here and skip all other kinds of infinities.

1. It's _much_ bigger than any real number.

    $$+ \infty > r, r \in \Bbb R$$

2. If you add any real number to infinity, you'll get exactly infinity.

    $$r + \infty = \infty, r \in \Bbb R$$

3. You can go further and even multiply infinity by real number, guess what you'll end up with?

    $$r \cdot \infty = \infty, r \in \Bbb R$$

What does that tell us? Well, you can pretty much add a gazillion to infinity. As long as this gazillion is quantifiable (i.e. a real number), then you'd get an infinity back.

~~~ {.subtle}
Does that mean that infinity is like a Black Hole so you can add anything to it or multiply it by anything and you'll still get back the exact same infinity?

Not quite. Turns out, if you multiply an infinity by another infinity, you'll get an infinity squared. And that one turns out to be _another_ kind of infinity which is, khm, infinitely greater than that first infinity.

$$\infty \cdot \infty = \infty^2 > \infty$$

However, math books say that adding one infinity to another infinity still equals infinity.

$$\infty + \infty = \infty$$

And if you're truly curious, then there's something more you need to know.

$$\infty - \infty = undefined$$

Oh well. Now life doesn't seem that complicated anymore.
~~~

Ok, that's about enough to keep our brain at reasonable temperature levels.

## What is "almost"?

Now, really. What does that "almost" part mean?

Let's try and be scholars about it. Say you have %%foo%% and you have %%foo_{almost}%% which is defined as "almost foo". Then there must be a small difference between %%foo%% and %%foo_{almost}%%. Mathematicians love to use an uppercase Greek letter Delta to indicate differences, so we'll do the same:

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta_{foo} & = & foo - foo_{almost} \\
foo_{almost} & = & foo - \Delta_{foo} \\
\end{eqnarray}
$$

Obviously.

It is also implied (mostly from the dictionaries that from math definitions) that the magnitude of "almost foo" is comparable to %%foo%% itself. This makes our %%\Delta_{foo}%% insignificant enough, which means it's smaller than both %%foo%% and %%foo_{almost}%%.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta_{foo} & < & foo              \\
\Delta_{foo} & < & foo_{almost}     \\
\end{eqnarray}
$$

## What is "almost infinity"?

First, let's figure what %%\Delta_\infty%% is.

$$
\Delta_\infty = \infty - \infty_{almost}
$$

Sounds pretty %%undefined%%, eh? But wait! We don't know what %%\infty_{almost}%% is, how can we tell for sure then?

Well, it turns out, we do know that %%\Delta_\infty < \infty%% and %%\Delta_\infty < \infty_{almost}%%.
