# Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Boris. I love creating software and solve problems.

I'm aÂ CTO at [UBIO](https://ub.io) â€” aÂ UK-based tech startup.
Together with an [amazing team](https://ub.io/about) of talented and dedicated people
we create tools and technology to make the Web programmable.

I love designing and building software, big and small, of different shapes and forms.
Over the course of my life I've built aÂ decent variety of applications and libraries. I've also builtÂ a few products top-to-bottom, from ideation to design and implementation.

If you fancy saying hello, please feel free to [reach out](mailto:boris@okunskiy.name).
