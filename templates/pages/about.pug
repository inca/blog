      p.kicker Hi, I'm Boris Okunskiy.
      p It's good to meet you. 👋

      I'm a Principal Software Engineer at [UBIO](https://ub.io) — a UK-based technology startup.
      Together with an [amazing team](https://ub.io/about) of talented and dedicated people
      we create tools and technology to automate the Web. We proudly call each other Ubees. 🐝

      I love designing and building software, big and small, of different shapes and forms.
      Over the course of my life I've built a variety of libraries, GUI apps, backend systems, APIs, distributed applications, SPAs and designed a few products top-to-bottom — so you can expect me to have an opinion on pretty much every possible subject. 😁

      I don't identify myself with any particular extreme of software engineering spectrum (frontend vs. backend), simply because I find myself wierdly attracted to many different kinds of challenges and I hate missing out on good opportunities. 🤓

      More importantly, I am a strong believer in _eclecticism_ — the practice of deriving ideas, concepts and principles from a broad and diverse range of sources. I believe that good design is applicable across all tiers of the stack, not just the tip of the iceberg. In this sense, being able to design APIs and libraries with great UX makes you a better designer of end user products. If you extrapolate far enough, you'll find that the same applies to virtually everything: visual aesthetics, mathematics, music and even cooking. 🍳

      Currently I enjoy writing code in TypeScript. For frontends I prefer Vue for its simplicity and much more coherent community. I don't shy away from vanilla JavaScript either (as long as it's actually written in TypeScript, hehe). This is not my résumé, so I won't bore you with listing each and every piece of technology I've ever worked with — let's just say I've seen things. 🙄

      Recently I've picked up Unity as a hobby, and even managed to make a [small game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alphamagenta.HexLaser) released (Android-only). I'm also very enthusiastic about computer graphics, animations and different kinds of procedural art. 👾

      Finally, I feel like I should state this somewhere, so here goes. I chose to not get myself involved with any kind of cryptocurrencies, tokens, blockchains, etc. Consider this to be my humble contribution to saving the Universe from [heat death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe). For our children and better future. 🌠

      Which leads me to...
