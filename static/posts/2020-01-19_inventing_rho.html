            <p class="subtitle">A quick guide to reinventing the most popular text-to-html markup language in the World.</p>
<p>Ok, here's a brief backstory. Roughly 5 years ago I've quit my job as a senior software developer + product owner + project manager + UX engineer + (poor) graphical designer + ... at [one company](https://eduterra.pro) and decided to try some new adventures as a plain simple senior developer at [some other company](https://ub.io).</p>
<p>If you work full-time with the same people and are committed enough to what you do, switching the job can become a life changing event: you get to meet new kinds of people, you face new kinds of challenges (both technical and not), you adapt (a lot!) to new situations and circumstances, you learn new awesome things and you (sometimes regretfully) abandon what you have learned before; ultimately, you learn to give up on things like your past achievements, look critically at your experience and sometimes even have to compromise your "core values" in an effort to be able to reach for a brighter future. Before you know it, you become a different person.</p>
<p>But anyway, this post is not about that. As I learned later, one part of the deal was that I had to abandon some cool open source projects I've created in past â€”Â no, not because it was forbidden on a new position to commit to open source or anything like that; it's not exactly the "I have no time" issue: I <em>did</em> have time to maintain these projects, but rather these projects weren't on top of the ever-growing list of my priorities. Simply speaking, over time I've lost the motivation to push them forward, and absence of leadership is fatal to software. It dies.</p>
<p class="sidenote">Even if you don't know what Markdown is, there's a decent chance you've seen it and even used it. Basically, it's the thing some software like GitHub or Slack use to make the text you type look fancier. For example, it can render a <code>*text like this*</code> into <strong>text like this</strong>.</p>
<p>One of such cool projects was [Rho](https://github.com/inca/rho) â€” a Markdown alternative with extra features, (rather rudimentary) extensibility and a dash of opinions.</p>

<p>So as part of my New Year Resolutionsâ„¢ in 2020 I've promised to myself to:</p>
<ol><li>revive my blogging activities</li>
<li>revive (and learn to appreciate) some really great things I've created in past</li></ol>
<p>In case you're reading this, my promises are actually getting fulfilled. Yay! ðŸŽ‰</p>
<h2>Initial design goals</h2>
<p>It may not sound like it, but back in 2013 it was about the same kind of crazy to start implementing a Markdown equivalent as it is in 2020. The year makes no difference at all: there are plenty of readily available implementations which satisfy <em>almost</em> all possible needs in the text-to-html business.</p>
<p>We still decided to do it though, for a number of reasons. Here are the ones I managed to derive from a hindsight (not necessarily sorted by importance).</p>
<ol><li><p>We needed a stricter, more predictable rules for core features, which are more easily understood by non-technical people.</p>
<p>The project was initially conceived for a relatively big e-learning platform featuring its own content management system. Part of making such platform successful was to make sure that non-technical people like professors, tutors, teachers, coaches of many different domains could easily create visually and structurally appealing content which would also be accessible for all sorts of devices and search engines, renderable into PDF and ePub, and friendly to revision control systems (you know, for situations when one person writes a lecture, and the other one proof reads it, you'd typically want to avoid loss of changes if the author later decides to rephrase that ugly sentence).</p>
<p>Standard Markdown featuring multiple ways of spelling headings, lists, em/strong elements and multiple flavours of code blocks (with magical 4 indentation) wasn't doing much good for ordinary people who were trying to create cheatsheets and developing some oddly sounding 4-space-tapping techniques in order to keep that semantic markup beast tamed (I bet they also hated us for having them to get used to Markdown and, after a while, abandon their hard earned habits).</p>
<p>Also, people produced a lot of content. We needed to make sure they stick to roughly the same style guide, so that people could easily take over the others' work.</p></li>
<li><p>We needed more!</p>
<p>Yeah, less is more, I ðŸ’¯ agree. With text content you don't typically need too much. Sometimes though, you need <em>just a tiny bit more</em> than your favorite Markdown can offer.</p>
<p>We were quick to realize that content needs a bit more stylistic diversity than what can be achieved by any kind of combinations of <code>p</code>, <code>ul</code>, <code>ol</code>, <code>li</code>, <code>hX</code>, <code>blockquote</code>, <code>pre</code> + handful more tags that Markdown can spit out. The concept of "selector expressions" I've introduced made a whole lot of difference: users could now add arbitrary classes to blocks by specifying <code>{.things.like.these}</code> on the first line. Now platform could provide a handful of block types like "pro tips", "warning", etc. to make its authors and readers almost infinitely happy!</p>
<p>We've also faced some interesting challenges when we first tried to make math formulae with [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) due to extensive use of backslashes in it and how Markdown was eager to digest them all.</p>
<p>And of course lots of smaller features (like being able to programmatically resolve media references like <code>![Alt text][some-id-from-database]</code> or, say, to support reusable markup fragments) definitely helped with engineering a better end product.</p></li>
<li><p>Ok now this one is tricky. It did not occur to me up until I have implemented that semantic text markup language myself. As it turns out, when you have a markup language you can control, at your disposal, you can do more with it. You start to have more ideas, which were not previously considered feasible.</p>
<p>This is how I've implemented a superset of semantic markup rules for creating quizzes from plain text. You, as an author, would write things like:</p>
<pre><code></code></pre><p>The library would render a form with radio buttons, without leaking any information about the correct answer, and on server side would have ways to validate the submitted answer. We've implemented the same for other types of tasks such as multiple choice, drag-to-order and even type text with diff-based answer assessment. It was so freaking cool!</p>
<p>From there I've conceived an idea of making the parser <em>extensible</em> so that anyone could write a parsing rule and effortlessly add it to parser â€”Â but I was never able to achieve that back then.</p></li>
<li><p>Last but not least, it was fun!</p>
<p>We tend to forget that software can be a bit more than just means to an end. I'm pretty sure everyone is familiar with this delightful feeling of accomplishment when carefully designed non-trivial program starts to produce the results you expect for the first time.</p></li></ol>
<p>As far as the open source goes, I've never had an ambition for Rho to take over the world. Markdown is crazy popular and even inertia aside, it has its own use cases and, therefore, its users. Not everyone necessarily cares about the parser being extensible, not every product needs to provide its users with more stylistic diversity (sometimes it's the other way around!), and sometimes it's just a matter of existing content being incompatible. That's right, full Markdown compatibility was never among the Rho design goals.</p>
<p class="idea">~~~ 
Did you know that Markdown was first implemented in Perl, with 1.0 release dated 28 Aug 2004 â€”Â whooping 16 years ago!
~~~</p>
<p>Still, Markdown definitely needed (and still needs) a hero. If you ever tried to tweak any existing Markdown library into doing what you want (e.g. to resolve the media objects externally like I've described above), you would be quick to find out it's virtually impossible to do so. Their parsers/lexers are [inherently monolithic](https://github.com/markedjs/marked/blob/master/src/Lexer.js#L52-L401) and in a nutshell are just a bunch of regular expressions on top of regular expressions, crunching strings like crazy.</p>
<h2>2020 re-design objectives</h2>
<p>So I decided to resume my blogging, and that's what prompted me to start renovating that poor old library covered with a thick layer of dust. Ugh. It was 2013, no modern ECMAScript features, just plain <code>Foo.prototype.bar =</code> assignments and loads of <code>var</code>. After all, 7 years is a lot in this industry.</p>
<p>It's time to renovate. But what to do exactly?</p>
<p>Since leadership in software world is just a fancy word to describe one's opinions, I've quickly got mine together and came up with roughly the following plan.</p>
<ol><li><p><strong>TypeScript.</strong> It makes absolutely no sense to start any serious development for Node.js / Browser library in any other language.</p>
<p>TypeScript is pretty much everywhere in the web now. Libs that have views to make it into the second quarter of XXI are already in TypeScript. And those poor ones who did not publish the typings to npm are probably dead. Presence or absence of typings has become a new heuristic of library liveliness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extensibility.</strong> Core should not contain any actual text processing rules. Rather, it should be a framework whereby all rules are implemented as separate modules and then can be plugged together to achieve the desired result.</p>
<p>This doesn't sound too complicated â€”Â but only until you get into the nitty gritty details. For example, lists are hierarchical blocks which may consist of other kinds of blocks, code blocks support a limited set of inline rules like escaping commong HTML characters (<code>&amp;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>) and are sensitive to indentation, some inline markup would contain nested inline markup and so forth.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in my opinion, designing a modular parsing system is one of the most important objectives for Rho. This would allow users to implement their own semantic markup rules and effortlessly add it to the processor, without having to modify the core itself. Imagine the possibilities! ðŸŒ </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Features vs compatibility.</strong> Initially I took a rather strong stance on compatibility with Markdown. For example, we defined that unordered lists would only use <code>* </code> markers (as opposed to Markdown which also supports <code>- </code> and <code>+ </code>). However, over time I've learned that some of these limitations were deal breakers for some users.</p>
<p>So I decided to relax a couple of constraints in an effort to make Rho more enjoyable experience for those already familiar with Markdown. And whilst 100% compatibility isn't something that I consider useful, I figured that a sweet spot is totally achievable.</p>
<p class="subtle">In theory, with extensibility it is possible to make Rho closer to full Markdown compatibility via plugins. Perhaps something for community to look into, hehe.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Performance.</strong> Not a crucially important one as it is unlikely you would compile megabytes of text in real time, and most content management solutions would just cache the produced html and only re-render when the source has changed.</p>
<p class="sidenote">My initial implementation was almost <strong>4 times slower</strong> than [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked), but I managed to squeeze some juice from it. ðŸ’ª It was an enjoyable experience, and I will write a separate post about it.</p>
<p>Besides, with more features added it is somewhat expected for performance to drop within reasonable levels.
    All things considered, it would still be nice to have comparable performance to "competitors".</p></li>
